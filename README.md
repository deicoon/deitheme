# Deitheme

Deitheme is a responsive theme for [Hugo](gohugo.io) with a focus on product showcasing (ideal for a small dev company/studio).
It's loosely based on [Minimalist](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme) â€“ actually it was mostly used as a scaffold for building this theme, as very little of Minimalist's code remains.

Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are easy localization (l10n), the nice responsive top navbar, and the product grid (please don't reuse this last item, or not as is, please).
